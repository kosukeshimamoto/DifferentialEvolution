# Reports

This repository keeps the latest benchmark and visualization outputs under
`reports/` so the results can be reviewed without rerunning scripts.

- `reports/README.md` describes each report folder and how to reproduce it.
- `reports/2d/` contains 2D convergence GIFs and a gallery HTML file.
- `reports/benchmarks/` contains benchmark summaries (CSV/MD/HTML) and plots.

If you want to regenerate any output, see the commands listed in
`reports/README.md`.
